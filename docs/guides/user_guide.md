## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Prompts

1. **Be Specific**
   - Instead of "What's in this image?", try "What objects can you identify in this image?"
   - Instead of "Describe this", try "Describe the scene, focusing on the main subject"

2. **Ask Follow-up Questions**
   - "What emotions does this image convey?"
   - "Can you identify any specific details about [object]?"
   - "How would you describe the composition of this image?"

3. **Use Natural Language**
   - Write as if you're talking to a person
   - Feel free to ask for clarification or more details
   - You can have a conversation about the image

### Example Prompts

1. **General Analysis**
   - "What can you see in this image?"
   - "Describe this scene in detail"
   - "What's the main subject of this image?"

2. **Specific Details**
   - "What colors are prominent in this image?"
   - "Can you identify any text or signs in the image?"
   - "What time of day does this image appear to be taken?"

3. **Emotional Response**
   - "What mood or atmosphere does this image convey?"
   - "How does this image make you feel?"
   - "What emotions might this image evoke in viewers?"

4. **Technical Analysis**
   - "What's the composition of this image?"
   - "How would you describe the lighting in this image?"
   - "What camera angle or perspective is used?"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
